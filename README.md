# C-Cpp

Hello. This is the main repository where I store my codes from the college exercises I made while learning C/C++.

Here you'll find data structures, arrays, pointers, structs, dynamic memory allocation, pattern drawing, and many other examples in which I apply my knowledge. Feel free to explore :)
